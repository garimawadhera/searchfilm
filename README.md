# searchfilm
Write an Android app that contains a search field to search for a movie and shows the results
Use IMDB API
Example search for Starship:
http://www.imdb.com/xml/find?json=1&nr=1&tt=on&q=Starship
● Show the results in any way you want
● Use Fragments
● Keep state on rotation (do not use ​android:configChanges=orientation ​)
(State means already loaded data. It’s ok to drop data that was requested but hasn’t
returned yet)
● Don’t use ContentProvider, Loaders
● Add some tests
